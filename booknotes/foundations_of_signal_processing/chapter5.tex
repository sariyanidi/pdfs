\section*{Chapter 5}

* The rate at which the approximation error $\hat{x}_T-x$ goes to zero for as $T\rightarrow 0$ is an important indicator of the approximation power of the interpolation scheme.
* Thm 5.1	
* Def: consistent (\#427)
* Def: ideally matched (\#427)
* Def: shift-invariant space and generator (\#430)

errata \#434 shouldn't it be $\hat{x}$

** follow the general structure of the chapter.
