\section*{Chapter 5}

$\mathcal{R}(AB) = R(A)$ if $B$ is an invertible matrix.

Riesz basis condition  implies the invertibility of the Gram matrix (footnote of FSP page 94).

Finite geom series: 
\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_{k=a}^{b}t^k=\begin{cases} \frac{t^a-t^{b+1}}{1-t} & \text{for } t\neq 1 \\ b-a+1 &
 \text{for } t=1
 \end{cases}
\end{equation}
